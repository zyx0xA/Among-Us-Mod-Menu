# What is this?

Probably you need a knowledge about code engineering or ye, there are 3 separated file. One is the disassembly code, generated by IDA and the Second file is a list of functions or hooks of "Axey's" mod menu. The .so file is a main Library of mod menu. You can just connect this Library on Among us game, i won't explain how to add it, cuz it takes to long to explain it lol...
